# Broswer-extention
** Functualities: **
1- The user can manually input a link (e.g: Google.com)
2- The user can save the current tab's URL by pressing on the "save tab" button
3- The user can delete all the links (aka "leads") to clear the application's page

Important notes: 
This is an extention that's used in a local environment using the Google Chrome version. Will be uploaded to the Firefox extention store and updated on the repo soon!
